# Amphibians

Amphibian is a dataset collected by field inventory of toll read projects derived from GIS (Geographic Information System) and satellite information, as well as from information gathered from the natural inventories that were prepared for the environmental impact assessment (EIA). This dataset consists of 189 data with 23 attributes. Attribute 2 to attribute 16 act as input data to perform classification. This collection of attributes itself consist of numerical attributes. While attribute 17 to 23 are categorical attributes, this collection of attributes aims to define the presence of amphibian species, such as green frogs, brown frogs, common toad, fire-bellied toad, tree frog, common newt, and great crested newt.

## Methods include:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Preprocessing
- Z-Score Normalization
- Machine Learning modelling: Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine
- Evaluation: Classification Report and Performance Comparison
